# ActiGraph-data
ActiGraph data provides data that contains counts or raw IMU data. IMU data contains accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. This repository contains several projects with utility for importing, filtering, and graphing this kind of ActiGraph data.
Additionally, this respository contains two convolutional neural network model and a peak detection-based repetitiong counting algorithm to determine if resistance training was performed across a day of wear-time data, what exercises were performed (out of 10 dumbbell exercises), and how many repetitions were performed across each exercise (between 8-12 repetitions).

This project could not be completed without the guidance of Dr. Paul Hibbing and the hard work of my research assistants who helped to process this data. Without these individuals, this work could not have been completed, and would be far less effective for assessing participation of resistance training in free-living conditions. 

This work hopes to build on the paucity of research looking at objectively measured resistance training. To our knowledge, this is the first project to objectively assess participation in resistance training in free-living conditions.
